This folder contains the Fusion 360 CAD for the TeachEE PCB enclosure. Currently, it is a simple 3D printed back plate to ensure that board is supported and not exposed to any short circuits when placed on metal surfaces.

The PCB is attached to the tray using M3 screws and heat-set inserts in the tray. Links to the parts are provided below:
